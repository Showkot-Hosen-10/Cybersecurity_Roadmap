## 1️⃣ What is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting **systems, networks, devices, and data** from cyber attacks such as hacking, malware, phishing, and data breaches.

It involves:

* Network security
* System & OS security
* Application & web security
* Cryptography & information security
* Incident detection and response

Cybersecurity ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad)** of information.

---

### (ii) CGPA Target for Higher Studies (MSc / PhD Abroad)

For **MS / MSc**:

* Target CGPA: **3.3 – 3.6+** (Top universities prefer **3.5+**)

For **PhD + Scholarships**:

* Target CGPA: **3.6 – 3.8+**
* Research experience > CGPA alone

High-demand destinations:

* Australia
* Canada
* Europe (Germany, Sweden, Finland)

Cybersecurity & AI-related fields have **excellent funded scholarship availability**.

---

### (iii) Future Scope of Cybersecurity (Will AI Kill This Field?)

**Short answer: NO.**

* AI is **increasing attacks**, not reducing them
* AI itself needs **secure systems, models, and data**
* New domains are emerging:

  * AI Security
  * Cloud Security
  * IoT & Critical Infrastructure Security

Cybersecurity will **evolve**, not die. It is more stable than many programming-only roles.

### (iv) How This Roadmap Helps with Thesis & ETE (CUET) Courses

Cybersecurity aligns STRONGLY with ETE courses:

| ETE Course                  | Cybersecurity Alignment                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Information Theory & Coding | Secure communication, error control         |
| CCN                         | Network attacks, IDS/IPS                    |
| Microprocessor              | Embedded & IoT security                     |
| VLSI                        | Hardware Trojans, chip security             |
| ML                          | Intrusion detection, malware analysis       |
| Image & Video Processing    | Forensics, surveillance security            |
| IoT                         | Smart grid, healthcare, industrial security |
| Engineering Ethics          | Privacy, law, digital responsibility        |

This roadmap helps you **select thesis topics** in:

* IDS/IPS
* Secure communications
* IoT & industrial security
* ML-based cyber defense

## 3️⃣ FAQ: Learning & Motivation Problems

### ❓ I forgot Intro to Cybersecurity. I feel bored to start again. What should I do?

✅ Do NOT rewatch everything.

* Read **chapter summaries only**
* Explain topics to a friend (peer discussion)
* Use ChatGPT for **Q&A based recall**
* Watch **short YouTube recaps (10–15 min)**

👉 Recall ≠ re-learning

---

### ❓ These courses are too theoretical. No labs like THM or HTB. How to stay motivated?

✅ Theory = foundation

* Cisco courses teach *"WHY"*, THM teaches *"HOW"*
* Without theory, you become a **command runner**
* With theory, you become a **Cybersecurity Engineer**

🔑 Finish theory first → Practical becomes EASY later

---

## 4️⃣ Pro Tips for Consistency

* Study **30–45 min/day**, not 5 hours once a week
* Keep a small **personal notes.md** file
* Teach juniors → retention increases by **2×**
* Don’t compare with seniors running tools
* Learn slowly but **consistently**

---

## 5️⃣ Final Message for Juniors

* Cybersecurity is a **long-term career**, not a quick hack
* Fundamentals decide your **job, research, and reputation**
* Be patient — real engineers are built slowly

✅ *This FAQ is meant to be revisited whenever you feel lost, bored, or unmotivated.*
